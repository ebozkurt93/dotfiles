# Instructions
Setup/installation instructions for a new macOS machine.

- Run all scripts with numeric order.
  - Ideally check the scripts before running them, some of these are development related therefore it might not be needed in all machines.

## Configure iTerm2 settings
Select the following path in iTerm2 options "General -> Preferences -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL"
`~/dotfiles/iterm2`

# Todos
- [ ] continue from macos default setting changes, check obsidian for some of these
- [ ] check what configuration/changes the installed apps need, document the changes while doing them
- [ ] handle [docker-compose files](https://github.com/ebozkurt93/docker-compose-files)
  - files are locally copied already, however we want to be able to set things up with these commands

## Maybe??
- [ ] brew install vagrant
